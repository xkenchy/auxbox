/**
 * The Cyberthentic class is like a magical messenger for secure communication. Imagine
 * sending secret messages and receiving important information, all happening in a secure,
 * well-organized way.
 *
 * **Sending Messages:** Let's start with sending messages. Think of it as writing a letter.
 * You just write your message and provide the address of the person you want to send it to.
 * Cyberthentic takes care of everything else. It makes sure your message is safe and sound
 * during its journey, even in the mysterious world of the internet. The magic here happens
 * with encryption, which is like sealing your letter with a special, secret seal so only
 * the intended recipient can open it.
 *
 * **Receiving Messages:** Now, it's not just about sending messages; you can also receive
 * them. You know when you check your mailbox for letters? Well, Cyberthentic does something
 * similar but in the digital realm. It connects to the magical mail server, fetches your
 * messages, and organizes them for you. It's like having a trusty butler who brings you
 * your letters every day. Cyberthentic even cleans up your mailbox, so you don't have to
 * deal with clutter.
 *
 * **Encryption:** You might be wondering about this encryption thing. It's like casting a
 * spell on your messages. It transforms them into secret code, so no one can understand
 * your message except the person it's meant for. So, it's like writing your letter in
 * a secret language that only you and your friend can understand. Pretty cool, right?
 *
 * **Logging:** Ever wanted to keep a diary of your magical adventures? Cyberthentic does
 * that too. It keeps a diary of what it's doing, but it's not just any diary. It's a magical
 * diary that writes down everything that happens with your messages. Every time you send or
 * receive a message, Cyberthentic writes it down in its special diary, so you can look back
 * and see what happened during each magical session.
 *
 * So, if you ever need to send secret messages, receive important information, and keep
 * everything well-organized and secure, think of Cyberthentic as your magical messenger.
 * It's like having a magical butler for your digital communications.

/**
 * DataMagic: A Magical Data Communication Class
 *
 * DataMagic is a versatile class that orchestrates secure and efficient communication
 * of messages and data. Imagine a magical tool that takes your messages, encrypts them,
 * sends them to their recipients, and even retrieves messages sent to you. This class
 * makes it all happen!
 *
 * - **Sending Messages:** You can send messages to one or more recipients in a secure way.
 *   DataMagic encrypts your messages, takes care of the technical details, and delivers
 *   them to their destinations.
 *
 * - **Receiving Messages:** Not only can you send messages, but DataMagic also lets you
 *   receive messages. It communicates with a server, retrieves messages meant for you,
 *   and provides you with the magic of data.
 *
 * - **Encryption:** DataMagic incorporates strong encryption techniques to ensure that
 *   your messages remain confidential and secure. It uses a combination of secret keys,
 *   salts, and cryptographic algorithms to perform encryption and decryption.
 *
 * - **Logging:** This class also takes care of logging. Each run of DataMagic creates a
 *   unique log file, so you can review what happened in each magical session.
 *
 * ## How to Use DataMagic
 *
 * Sending messages is as simple as calling the `send` method, providing the recipient's
 * address and the message to send. DataMagic will handle the rest.
 *
 * To receive messages, call the `receive` method, which connects to the server and fetches
 * messages for you. It even deletes messages you've already retrieved, keeping your
 * communication organized.
 *
 * ## Configuration
 *
 * DataMagic allows you to configure your magic. You can set a secret key for encryption,
 * specify the encryption salt, and control key generation parameters like iteration count
 * and key length.
 *
 * ## Logging and Error Handling
 *
 * DataMagic keeps a log of its activities in unique log files, one for each run. This
 * log includes information about successful API calls and how the magic unfolds.
 * Should anything go wrong, DataMagic does its best to handle errors and provide helpful
 * information.
 *
 * DataMagic, your magical data communicator, is here to make your life easier and
 * your communication more secure. Use it wisely, and let the magic happen!
